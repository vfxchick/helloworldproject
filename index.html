        <p>About transitions:  
            For simple transition effects, include transition.js once alongside the other JS files. If you're using the compiled (or minified) bootstrap.js, there is no need to include thisâ€”it's already there.
        </p>

        <p>What's inside:  
            Transition.js is a basic helper for transitionEnd events as well as a CSS transition emulator. It's used by the other plugins to check for CSS transition support and to catch hanging transitions.
